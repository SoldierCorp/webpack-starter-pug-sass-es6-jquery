Webpack project starter with Pug, Sass/Stylus, jQuery, VanillaJS, Babel and Yarn

---

## Now working with Webpack 5 ðŸŽ‰
You can still use Webpack 4 by downloading [this branch](https://github.com/SoldierCorp/webpack-starter-pug-sass-es6-jquery/tree/webpack-4)

The purpose of this Webpack Starter is to allow people to create websites without any framework/library like React, Angular, Vue but only using simple but powerful technologies to build quality websites.

With this starter you can have clean URLs by removing the .html extension. For example:

- *website.com/contact*
- *website.com/blog*
- *website.com/profile*

## Demo

- Scripting: `jQuery or VanillaJS(plain Javascript)`
